                    Logo design is all about creating the perfect visual brand
                    mark for a company. Depending on the type, a logo usually
                    consists of a symbol or brandmark and a logotype, along with
                    a tagline..........

                    McDonald’s logo wins out, because it visually represents the
                    brand in the most basic form possible. The Golden Arches
                    form an M, the first letter in McDonald’s. However, the fact
                    “the arches” are golden, reminds you of fries. Then the
                    smell, then the desire. The whole logo conjures up thoughts
                    of the brand. They’ve used their logo to simply represent

                    When you think of a person who’s impacted your life, it’s
                    almost certain that you can picture what he or she looks
                    like. And so it is with the brands from which we often buy.
                    We can easily picture the logo just by thinking about our
                    experiences with the product, company or service. Where
                    there was once just a handful of companies operating within
                    a particular market or niche, there might now be hundreds,
                    maybe thousands, all competing for attention, all wanting us
                    to look at them first..............
